# Local Setup Instructions for Job Hunter Project

To run the Job Hunter application locally, please ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A running PostgreSQL server on `localhost`.
- A Reed API key (obtainable for free from Reed).
- A SendGrid API key (also available for free).

## Fork and Setup the Backend

1. Fork the GitHub repository for the project.
2. Clone your forked repository locally using `git clone <repository-url>`.
3. Navigate into the backend directory: `cd backend`.
4. Install the necessary Node.js dependencies: `npm install`.
5. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and set the following environment variables:

    ```
    PORT=8089 # Or any port you prefer
    COOKIE_EXPIRATION=2592000000 # 30 days, in milliseconds
    EMAIL=* # Email for sending password resets
    REED_API_BASE_URL=https://www.reed.co.uk/api/1.0
    REED_API_KEY=your_reed_api_key_here
    SALT_ROUNDS=10
    JWT_EXPIRATION=2592000000 # 30 days
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
    PG_DATABASE=your_postgres_db_name
    PG_HOST=localhost # Default
    PG_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
    PG_PORT=5432 # Default PostgreSQL port
    PG_USER=your_postgres_user
    SG_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
    ```
6. In `index.js`, uncomment the CORS-related lines as instructed in the file comments.
7. Start the backend server: `node index.js`.

## Set Up the Frontend

1. In a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of the cloned project.
2. Go into the frontend application directory: `cd jobhunter`.
3. Install the required npm packages: `npm install`.
4. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with the following content:

    ```
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8089 # Use the backend PORT
    VITE_OPENCAGE_API_KEY=your_opencage_api_key_here # If geolocation feature is needed
    ```
5. Launch the frontend development server: `npm run dev`.
6. The application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

Please ensure that the PostgreSQL server is running, and you have created the necessary database and tables as per the application requirements.
